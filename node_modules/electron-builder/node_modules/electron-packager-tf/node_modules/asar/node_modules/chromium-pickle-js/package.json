  "readme": "# chromium-pickle-js\n\nThis module ports Chromium's `Pickle` class to Node, see `Pickle`'s header for\nintroduction:\n\n> This class provides facilities for basic binary value packing and unpacking.\n>\n> The Pickle class supports appending primitive values (ints, strings, etc.)\n> to a pickle instance.  The Pickle instance grows its internal memory buffer\n> dynamically to hold the sequence of primitive values.   The internal memory\n> buffer is exposed as the \"data\" of the Pickle.  This \"data\" can be passed\n> to a Pickle object to initialize it for reading.\n>\n> When reading from a Pickle object, it is important for the consumer to know\n> what value types to read and in what order to read them as the Pickle does\n> not keep track of the type of data written to it.\n>\n> The Pickle's data has a header which contains the size of the Pickle's\n> payload.  It can optionally support additional space in the header.  That\n> space is controlled by the header_size parameter passed to the Pickle\n> constructor.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ npm install chromium-pickle-js\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### createEmpty()\n\nReturns an empty `Pickle` object.\n\n### createFromBuffer(buffer)\n\n* `buffer` Buffer\n\nReturns a `Pickle` object that initialized from a `buffer`. The data is not\ncopied so you have to ensure the `buffer` lives when using the Pickle object,\nand you should never modify the Pickle object created this way.\n\n### Pickle.createIterator()\n\nReturns a `PickleIterator` object that can be used to read data from this\n`Pickle` object.\n\n### Pickle.toBuffer()\n\nReturns a `Buffer` object that contains this `Pickle` object's data.\n\n### Pickle.writeBool(value)\n\nWrites `value` to `Pickle` object as `bool`. Returns `true` when succeeded and\nreturns `false` when failed.\n\n### Pickle.writeInt(value)\n\nWrites `value` to `Pickle` object as `int`. Returns `true` when succeeded and\nreturns `false` when failed.\n\n### Pickle.writeUInt32(value)\n\nWrites `value` to `Pickle` object as `uint32`. Returns `true` when succeeded and\nreturns `false` when failed.\n\n### Pickle.writeInt64(value)\n\nWrites `value` to `Pickle` object as `int64`. Returns `true` when succeeded and\nreturns `false` when failed.\n\n### Pickle.writeUInt64(value)\n\nWrites `value` to `Pickle` object as `uint64`. Returns `true` when succeeded and\nreturns `false` when failed.\n\n### Pickle.writeFloat(value)\n\nWrites `value` to `Pickle` object as `float`. Returns `true` when succeeded and\nreturns `false` when failed.\n\n### Pickle.writeDouble(value)\n\nWrites `value` to `Pickle` object as `Double`. Returns `true` when succeeded and\nreturns `false` when failed.\n\n### Pickle.writeString(str)\n\n* `str` String\n\nWrites `str` to `Pickle` object. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns\n`false` when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readBool()\n\nReturns current value as `bool` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readInt()\n\nReturns current value as `int` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readUInt32()\n\nReturns current value as `uint32` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readInt64()\n\nReturns current value as `int64` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readUInt64()\n\nReturns current value as `uint64` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readFloat()\n\nReturns current value as `float` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readDouble()\n\nReturns current value as `double` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n\n### PickleIterator.readString()\n\nReturns current value as `String` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception\nwould be thrown when failed.\n",
